# Poll-survey
2020 presidential poll
In this data set there are two sheet(sheet 1 and sheet 2),both sheet have 17 variables. 
I upgraded the dataset by switching numbers to dates and words to numbers.Converting numbers to dates allows for chronological analysis, helping understand when events occurred. Transforming words to numbers enables quantitative assessments, facilitating comparisons and statistical analysis across different variables. 
I deleted rows with missing values because they were making my dataset less reliable for analysis. Removing these rows helps ensure that my data is accurate and unbiased, so I can trust the results of my analysis.
I cleaned the cycle, candidate name, model date, track, poll Id and question Id because this data is 2020 presidential poll data where the column cycle, candidate name and model date represent only one things(2020, Joe biden and 11-05-2020), so that i removed this columns.
Also i removed the track column because its not showing any relevant information about the data. And poll Id and question Id is just a nominal data which provides specific identification number of the poll and question, which doesnot provide any useful information about poll and question this is the reason to remove this column.
